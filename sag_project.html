                <h1>Information about the gamejam</h1>

                <h2>What happened</h2>
                <p>This project was created by me and 3 others. This happened after the game jam event I participated in, and I really enjoyed making a game, so I was very happy that there was a genuine way to develop one for this project whilst still managing to meet all the required criteria for the "systems analysis" part of the project. As a team we all agreed that it was a fun way to work on the assigment, and I had a lot of passion fueling me during development after having developed a game not too long ago</p>

                <h2>What we made</h2>
                <p>The idea was to create a Rogulike, bullet hell RPG, and we managed to do this. This was because this was a mix of genres we were familiar with playing, and also excited to devlop for, but most importantly it fit in to the systems analysis portion of the project, also because continuing work on this was an option for the final year dissertation</p>
                <p>Overall this project was a very successful one, we managed to finish with enough time to plan a powerpoint presentation including cupcakes, music, a speaker setup, and a consideration for costumes too. </p>

                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I'm personally really happy with this project in general and managed to learn a lot throughout it too</p>
                <p>- I learned that I'm really good at managing a small team, when we got together in a group I made sure we all had a designnated role, created a discord server with multiple channels so evreyone knew what they had to do, what other people were doing, and we all could chip in at any moment to help with eachothers work, or proivde feedback. This was an improvment over the previous game I made as we had virtually no communication, it felt more like we spoke whilst together at uni for a few hours, then all the work was done by me at home working on the game, and we didn't manage to talk again until the following day with moments before the deadline </p>
                <p>- Another improvment over the previous game was the inclusion of text, I went through a few tutorials and managed to get working animated text, although it was still in early development, it worked relatively well and meant the game finally had a story and tutorial implemented </p>
                <p>- A lot of work was put into making sure the game used more efficient methods than before making use of scripts within GMS2 which work similar to functions whhich can be called, this update was thanks to my learning at uni with OOP and looking into some videos explaining game development, this made the planning process far more time consuming, but meant the system as a whole would be easie to maintain test and upgrade in the future too.</p>
                <p>If you're Interested in seeing the game, there's a YouTube link below which shows off the general gameplay, it's currently a werid developmentbuild lacking some of the original levels so it's incomplete compared to the original finished project, but does show the general way the game works</p>
