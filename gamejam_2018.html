                <h1>Information about the gamejam</h1>

                <h2>What happened</h2>
                <p>- In my 2nd year at Worcester uni I took part in the 2018 GameJam event</p>
                <p>- I was in a team of 4, and my role was developing the code for the game</p>
                <p>- We were given 24 hours to create a playable game from scratch</p>
                <p>- The theme the game had to revolve around was "Big Bang"</p>

                <h2>What we made</h2>
                <p>- A space themed bullet hell game where you play as a sentient higgs boson particle that decided to destroy the universe by creating a big bang</p>

                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>- There is definitely such a thing as having too much coffee in a single day</p>
                <p>- A tutorial is very important for a video game, this was more of an after thought for us when seeing other projects, and also realising it's not common knowledge to everyone what the controls would be for the game (Although we'd argue the target audience would know)</p>
                <p>- Testing a game using multiple people is important, as the only person testing the game it was tailored towards my own skill level on far too much coffee, and as a result not many people could get very far into the fight which detracted from the fun </p>
                <p>- It's important to create a pattern which is 100% skill based for dodging the bulletts, I ended up with entirely random meteors that could create an impossible to dodge situation</p>
                <p>- Particle systems in Game Maker Studio 2 are absolutely amazing and allowed me to create a gorgeous looking game with minimal time and effort and -10 artistic skill</p>
                <p>Placing text into the game is a far more tedious and time consuimg task than I expected, we didn't end up with our story inside the game as a result</p>        
                <p>It's easy to be ambitous and waste time on ideas which ultimately aren't feasible, we originally were going to have a boss fight for every single planet in the solar system ending with the sun as the final boss, but quickly realised how much effor this would take and used the assets created for the extra planets as an extra hard sun boss battle instead</p>

            <h2>Controls</h2>

            <p>Spacebar = Shoot</p>
            <p>Alt + F4 = Close Game (This is the only way to close it)</p>

            <h2>Things to be aware of</h2>
            <p>The game auto plays with no menu and there is not pause button</p>
            <p>Your hitbox is incredibly small (the small circle inside your playable character)</p>
            <p>I have never seen another person beat this game, so good luck!</p>
